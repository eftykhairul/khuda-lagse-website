            <p>Don't diet, Eat more and more but remember one thing eat healty whatever you it just eat healthy.Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.

            </h1>
            <p>
                Fahrin Zannat Faiza started her journey as a food-blogger when she realized that people in Dhaka were being deprived of honest and unbiased reviews. Since starting her Facebook page, she has received unbelievable support from people around her and is astonished at how other foodies such as herself value her opinion and make decisions based on her opinion. Going forward, Faiza hopes to make better content for her followers. Even though it was very difficult for Faiza to narrow down her choices for her favorite restaurant, she singled out 138 EAST, saying that it has yet to disappoint her. The Mushroom Soup and Alfredo Pasta on their menu is what she orders every time she visits 138 EAST. Initially, Faiza had started food photography with her mobile phone, but as more and more people joined her page, she decided to upgrade to a camera. Now she uses a Sony a6000 for her work.
